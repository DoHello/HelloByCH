            <div class="newsNr">
              <h4>How to win, manage  and optimise Hotel Prices Ads on Google</h4>
              <p>As we all know, Google  entered the hotel metasearch game with the introduction of Google Hotel Price  Ads (HPA) in a number of Google products. </p>
              <p>These included Google  Hotel Finder, Google Maps, Google+ Local and Google Search on desktop, tablet  and, increasingly, mobile devices. </p>
              <p><strong>NB</strong>:  This article is written by Wei Xia (VP of new products and services) and  Quentin Moores (director of metaSearch business development) from DerbySoft. </p>
              <p>According to Google: </p>
              <p>&ldquo;Hotel Price Ads is a feature  that assists users who are researching travel by surfacing hotel rates and  availability across Google properties&rdquo;. </p>
              <h4>So why it is important for you? </h4>
              <p>In a recent Google  partner event during ITB Berlin, Nicola Simionato, Google&rsquo;s general manager for  travel in EMEA &amp; APAC, explained why Google introduced HPA.</p>
              <p>He quoted Google co-founder  Larry Page: </p>
              <p>&ldquo;The perfect search engine should understand  exactly what you mean and give you back exactly what you need.&rdquo; </p>
              <p>He then declared Google&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hotel Price  Ads is NOT just another meta search experience!&rdquo; </p>
              <p>It is all part of Google  vision about future of search: &ldquo;Answer, Converse, Anticipate.&rdquo; Google will be  &ldquo;committed to create the best hotel search experience on Search and Maps,  across desktop/tablet/mobile&rdquo; and &ldquo;on Google Mobile Maps App&rdquo; in 2014,  according to Tom Mulders, Google&rsquo;s senior program manager for HPA. </p>
              <p>Google is expected to  gradually shift more and more traffic to HPA, possibly at the expense of  AdWords and organic SERP. With roughly two thirds of travel searches  originating from Google, hotel marketers and advertising agencies could ignore  this trend at their own peril. </p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <h4>Challenges for hotel marketers </h4>
              <p>In the same Google  event, many partners, while excited about Google&rsquo;s promise of more traffic and  higher ROI for HPA, expressed their concerns on how to effectively manage and  optimize this program. </p>
              <p>First, a hotel must  connect via its CRS or booking engine to Google through an HPA feed, which  includes Hotel Feeds, Price Feeds and a Point of Sales configuration file. </p>
              <p>This can be challenging  given the complexity and dynamic nature of Google&rsquo;s API and the requirement for  suppliers to keep up with those changes while maintaining the high accuracy  Google requires. </p>
              <p>New features and  merchandising opportunities are added frequently such as room bundling and tag  lines. </p>
              <p>Second, hotels are  strangers to managing real time bidding for metasearch marketing, which is  further complicated by the fact that HPA bidding, while the most sophisticated  among all meta search engines, is far more complex than AdWord bidding. </p>
              <p>The upshot of this is  that either hotel suppliers are not getting enough click volume because of low  bids, or they are bidding too high for positions that result in an inconsistent  ROI. </p>
              <p>Hotel suppliers and  their agencies are having a hard time keeping up with the speed and complexity  required to manage, tracking and reporting on Google HPA campaigns. </p>
              <h4>Help is available! </h4>
              <p>The good news is that  help is available. Google promises to make it easy for small and independent  hotels to participate and manage HPA programs with its own front-end, but there  are several third party partners to help hotels to implement and manage their  HPA campaigns. </p>
              <p>Not all the tools and  vendors are created equal. Some just provide basic connectivity services or  manual/semi-automatic bidding support, while some provide advanced automatic  bidding optimization. </p>
              <p>So how do you choose  which tool and partner to use and how to use it? In this article, we will focus  on bidding, but HPA feed is equally important. </p>
              <p>We will address this  briefly at the end of this article and there will be more to come in future  articles. </p>
             
              <h4>How does Google HPA bidding work? </h4>
              <p>First let&rsquo;s briefly  summarize the process behind the bidding platform for Google HPA. </p>
              <p class="center"><img src="images/webpage2.jpg"/></p>
              <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
              <p>Google uses an auction  model similar to the AdWords auction model: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>When the user selects a hotel property, the list of  partners who have provided prices and bids for that property are selected </li>
                <li>From the initial list, partners who can best serve  the user (in terms of language, support for currency, device, etc.) are  retained. </li>
                <li>From the filtered list, partners with similar prices  are grouped into buckets and are ranked in ascending order of price </li>
                <li>Within each price bucket, the partners are then  ranked based on bid value. The top four to six partners (depending on sites)  based on this ranking are shown in order </li>
                <li>If a partner is bidding lower than the reserve bid,  he will not show, regardless of its price bucket. </li>
              </ul>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>A base bid is either a  fixed fee per room night, or a percentage of room rate total. </p>
              <p>But on top of base bid,  you can specify a bid multiplier for a variety of factors. You can adjust the  multipliers to increase or decrease your bids for a specific Google site, user  country, device (mobile or desktop/tablet), and length of stay, and more to  come… </p>
              <p>So you can see, this can  get quite complex, but equally powerful for targeting and rate optimization. </p>
              <h4>Options to manage Google HPA bidding</h4>
              <p>Let&rsquo;s look at some of  the tools available: 1. Manually manage bidding with the Google Partner Front  End Google provides a free tool called Partner Front End to manage bidding  online. Suppliers can manage the bidding manually though this UI for a property  or a group of properties. It also provides some basic charts and reports.  Suppliers can also bid up or down manually according to Google&rsquo;s report. </p>
              <p>Pros: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Free </li>
                <li>Simple </li>
              </ul>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Cons: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Scalability – It can be very time consuming and hard  to achieve optimized performance for a large number of properties. </li>
              </ul>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Analytics – The reports  and chart do not aggregate the performance data such as booking, conversion and  ROI data, giving a limited picture of campaign performance. </p>
              <p class="center"><img src="images/webpage3.jpg"/></p>
              <h4>2. Manual or semi-automatic bidding through a 3rd party tool </h4>
              <p>This approach still  manages bidding manually or by automating some tasks through some kind of &ldquo;bulk  bidding&rdquo; or &ldquo;budget&rdquo;. </p>
              <p>Some tools just allow  you to set a fixed budget per month. You can spend this budget but it does not  promise to optimize your bidding to meet your specific marketing objective such  as ROI. Other platforms provide reporting analytics to help you identify  &ldquo;opportunities&rdquo; or receive an &ldquo;alert&rdquo; or &ldquo;signal&rdquo; to adjust bids. However you  still have to decide how and when to bid. </p>
              <p>Pros: <br>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Very flexible if the supplier is quick to understand  the correct bidding decisions to make according to the reporting and analytics </li>
                <li>Somewhat reduced workload with the automation of the  bulk bidding update. </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Cons: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Time consuming—it takes time and skill to understand  the analytics and interpret them to make the best decisions </li>
                <li>Human Error—requires human intelligence for the  bidding strategy </li>
                <li>No Optimization—achieving optimized campaign results  and business goals is very difficult without intelligent automation. </li>
              </ul>
              <h4>3. Automatic bidding according to marketing objectives by  property</h4>
              <p>This algorithm allows  you to automatically calculate the bids according to your marketing objective  for a specific property. For example, a supplier that wishes to maintain a  certain position for a hotel can use algorithmic bid management to calculate  the bid automatically. </p>
              <p>The supplier only needs  to specify which position it wants to maintain, and the algorithm will predict  the optimum bid and adjust the bid daily to reach the targeted position. </p>
              <p>This algorithm works at  the individual property level and can support individual marketing strategies  independent of each other. </p>
              <p>Pros: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Proxy Metrics – Useful for marketing initiatives  such as brand awareness or share of voice. </li>
              </ul>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Cons: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Does not meet ROI goal – Does not meet a business  goal such as maximizing revenue or profit for a large number of properties <strong></strong></li>
              </ul>
              <p class="center"><img src="images/webpage4.jpg"/></p>
              <h4>4. Bidding optimization according to overall business goals for  a portfolio of hotel properties</h4>
              <p>This approach optimizes  the overall performance of a portfolio according to business goals such as  maximizing revenue for a given budget for the entire hotel chain or a subset of  hotels. It operates at the portfolio level rather than at the individual  property level.</p>
              <p class="center"><img src="images/webpage5.jpg"/></p>
              <p>Pros: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Intuitive Bidding—considers performance and ROI at a  portfolio level to inform individual property bidding </li>
                <li>Predictive decision support—decides where to most  effectively spend the next $1 </li>
              </ul>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Cons: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Automation—doesn&rsquo;t work well with manual  intervention </li>
                <li>More the better—Contrary to single property bidding  automation, portfolio optimization algorithm works better for more properties  in a portfolio. </li>
              </ul>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>For example , a  portfolio goal might be to maximize the overall revenue and maintain an ROI of  at least 10. For a given hotel in this example, let us assume the current data  is: </p>
                <p class="center"><img src="images/table1.jpg"/></p>
                <p>The question is, how  should the supplier optimize the bidding for this portfolio to maximize  revenue? </p>
              <p>If the supplier treats these  two sites independently, then both meet the minimum ROI target, so no  optimization is necessary to maintain the position.</p>
              <p>If the supplier wishes  to increase the marketing budget, at first glance it would seem that the  supplier should increase spending on &ldquo;Google Maps&rdquo; as its ROI is higher. </p>
              <p>But in reality, the  opposite is the case; as this hotel is already in position 1 for &ldquo;Google Maps&rdquo;,  increased spending would not result in more bookings. </p>
              <p>In other words, it is  the past return that matters, so a past return that is marginal determines  where the supplier should invest its next $1. </p>
              <p>In the portfolio  optimization algorithm, as long as the minimum is being met, the algorithm will  do what it can to optimize the overall portfolio. </p>
              <p>So, back to the example,  by spending more to move the &ldquo;Hotel Finder&rdquo; position up, the supplier increases  revenue to $1000, but ROI drops to 8. However, by combining these &ldquo;Google Maps&rdquo;  and &ldquo;Hotel Finder&rdquo; for the portfolio, the supplier still maintains an ROI of 10  and maximizes the revenue while maintaining that constraint. </p>
              <p>Combining sites  together:</p>
               <p class="center"><img src="images/table2.jpg"/></p>
              <p>The revenue is increased  from $2200 to $3000, though ROI is dropped from 11.79 to 10.29, it is still  above target of 10. </p>
              <p>Result: 36% increase in  revenue, while still reaching ROI target &gt; 10. </p>
              <p>The same is true if the  supplier wishes to maximize performance for multiple hotel properties across  multiple sites. </p>
              <h4>Case study of portfolio optimization bidding algorithm </h4>
              <p>Portfolio Bid  Optimization is proven to deliver dramatic improvements toward reaching core  metasearch marketing goals such as maximizing revenue, profit, or ROI.</p>
              <p>Such improvements can  often be seen immediately following implementation of new algorithms as  evidenced by the following results of actual campaigns running DerbySoft&rsquo;s  Portfolio Optimization Algorithm: </p>
              <p class="center"><img src="images/ROI.jpg"/></p>
              <p class="center"><img src="images/BOOKING.jpg"/></p>
              <h4 align="left">How about HPA Feed?</h4><br>
                Though bidding is the primary method to optimize Google HPA, HPA feeds,  the connectivity with Google HPA, is also very important factor for your  overall performance:<br>
  <strong>1. Hotel Feeds</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Hotel Chains  need to send a property list to Google which includes static information such  as hotel name, address, phone number, geo location.&nbsp;It is very important  to have accurate and complete information as Google uses this file to match the  hotels in your file with the hotels in Google&rsquo;s database.</li>
              </ul>
              <p align="left"><strong>2. Point of Sales Configuration</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Point of  Sales Configuration tells Google what the user will see on Google and which  site does the user go to book the room based on user&rsquo;s search.&nbsp;It depends  on user language, country, currency, device and site. It decides where a search  converts to a booking. It is also important for tracking and reporting.</li>
              </ul>
              <p align="left"><strong>3. Rate and availability accuracy</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>As explained  above, Google continually polices the accuracy of rate and availability, and  consistently low accuracy (&lt;95%) will cause Google to disable the  ad.&nbsp;Incorrect rate and availability will also lower the conversion rate  and ROI.</li>
              </ul>
              <p align="left"><strong>4. Room bundles</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Though a  supplier could send all possible room types and rate plans to Google, it is not  necessarily a case of &ldquo;more is better&rdquo;.&nbsp;Not all room types and rate plans  will convert, so a supplier needs to decide how many and which room bundles it  will display on Google HPA.</li>
              </ul>
              <p align="left"><strong>5. Tag Lines</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Content like  Tag Lines play an important role to convert an impression to a click and then  to a booking. It also could differentiate a hotel supplier from other OTA  suppliers.</li>
              </ul>
              <p align="left">It is important to select a vendor who truly understand connectivity and  has experience in managing Google HPA feeds.<br>
                Not all vendors have implemented all these features; some are using  out-of-date methods like screen scraping to get inventory information which  results in high rate discrepancies negating the effort and costs of bidding in  the first place.<br>
  <h4>Conclusion</h4> <br>
                When a supplier evaluates a solution to manage and optimize its Google  Hotel Price Ad campaign, there are many different approaches.<br>
                A seasoned marketer will select the best methodology and tool to support  specific business objectives.<br>
                Looking beyond bells and whistles, the real question is which tool will  enable the supplier to reach its business target in the shortest time and  optimize the results at scale with the least effort and lowest risk?<br>
